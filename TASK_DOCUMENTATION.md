# Product Management System - Task Documentation

## Task Documentation - Day 1

**Task:** Setup Maven Project, Install IntelliJ IDEA, and Install MySQL  
**Date Completed:** September 12, 2025

### 1. Objective
Setup development environment with Maven project structure, IntelliJ IDEA IDE, and MySQL database for the Product Management System.

### 2. Steps Taken
- Created Maven project with standard directory structure
- Configured `pom.xml` with Java 17 and UTF-8 encoding
- Installed IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
- Configured IDE with JDK 17 and Maven integration
- Installed MySQL Community Server with Workbench
- Configured MySQL service for automatic startup

### 3. Challenges Encountered
**Maven Configuration:** Project defaulted to Java 8 instead of Java 17.
**Resolution:** Updated `pom.xml` compiler properties to Java 17.

**MySQL Service:** Service failed to start automatically.
**Resolution:** Configured automatic startup through Windows Services.

### 4. Verification
- Compiled project successfully using Maven
- Verified IDE integration and syntax highlighting
- Connected to MySQL server and executed test queries

## Task Documentation - Day 2

**Task:** Create Model Package and Implement CRUD Methods   
**Date Completed:** September 12, 2025

### 1. Objective
Develop core business logic with Product model and implement CRUD operations for product management.

### 2. Steps Taken
- Created `Product.java` model class with fields: id, name, price, quantity
- Implemented getters, setters, and business methods (`getTotalValue()`, `isInStock()`)
- Created `ProductService.java` with CRUD operations:
  - `addProduct()` - Add new products with duplicate prevention
  - `removeProductById()` - Remove products using Stream API
  - `updateProductQuantity()` - Update product quantities with validation
  - `searchProductById()` - Find products by ID
  - `getAllProducts()` - Return all products with defensive copying
- Developed console UI in `Main.java` with menu-driven interface
- Integrated service layer with user interface

### 3. Challenges Encountered
**Stream API Implementation:** Difficulty with case-insensitive search functionality.
**Resolution:** Used `toLowerCase()` and `contains()` methods for proper filtering.

**Data Integrity:** External modification of returned product lists.
**Resolution:** Implemented defensive copying in `getAllProducts()` method.

### 4. Verification
- Successfully compiled and executed application
- Tested all CRUD operations with sample data
- Verified menu navigation and data persistence

## Task Documentation - Day 3

**Task:** Implement Exception Handling Across the Project  
**Date Completed:** September 12, 2025

### 1. Objective
Implement comprehensive exception handling to ensure application stability and provide user-friendly error messages.

### 2. Types of Exception Handling Implemented

#### 1. **NumberFormatException Handling**
- Used in input validation methods for integer and double parsing
- Catches invalid numeric input and prompts user to retry
- Implementation in `getValidInt()` and `getValidDouble()` methods

#### 2. **Range Validation Exceptions** 
- Custom validation for out-of-range values (negative IDs, prices, quantities)
- Menu choice validation (0-5 range)
- Prevents invalid business logic operations

#### 3. **Null Pointer Exception Prevention**
- Null checks for Product objects in service methods
- String validation to prevent empty/null inputs
- Defensive programming approach

#### 4. **Business Logic Exceptions**
- Duplicate ID prevention in `addProduct()` method
- Product existence validation before update/delete operations
- Invalid operation handling with meaningful error messages

#### 5. **Input Buffer Management**
- Standardized input handling using `scanner.nextLine().trim()`
- Prevents input skipping issues between different data types
- Consistent buffer clearing approach

### 3. Steps Taken
- Created robust input validation framework with retry mechanisms
- Implemented try-catch blocks for all user input operations
- Added validation layers in ProductService class
- Enhanced method return handling with boolean success indicators
- Developed standardized error message format
- Reduced code complexity while improving error handling

### 4. Challenges Encountered
**Input Buffer Management:** Scanner buffer issues when mixing input types.
**Resolution:** Standardized all input methods to use `scanner.nextLine().trim()`.

**Error Message Consistency:** Technical error messages confused users.
**Resolution:** Developed user-friendly error message standards.

### 5. Verification
- Tested all input validation scenarios (invalid numbers, empty strings, out-of-range values)
- Verified business logic exception handling (duplicate IDs, non-existent products)
- Confirmed system stability under continuous invalid input
- Application runs without crashes and provides clear error guidance
