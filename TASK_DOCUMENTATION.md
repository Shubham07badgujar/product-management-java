## Task Documentation - Day 2

**Task:** Create Model Package and Implement CRUD Methods   
**Date Completed:** September 12, 2025

### 1. Objective
Develop the core business logic layer of the Product Management System by creating a comprehensive model package with Product entity class and implementing essential CRUD operations including Add Product, Remove Product, Update Product Quantity, and Search Product functionality. This establishes the foundation for all product management operations with proper data encapsulation and business rule enforcement.

### 2. Steps Taken

#### Model Package Creation:
1. Created `model` package under `src/main/java/model/`
2. Designed and implemented `Product.java` class with the following specifications:
   - Private fields: `id` (int), `name` (String), `price` (double), `quantity` (int)
   - Parameterized constructor for complete object initialization
   - Complete getter and setter methods for all fields
   - Business logic methods: `getTotalValue()`, `isInStock()`
   - Overridden `toString()` method for formatted display
   - Implemented `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods for proper object comparison

#### Service Layer Implementation:
3. Created `service` package under `src/main/java/service/`
4. Implemented `ProductService.java` class with core CRUD operations:

#### Add Product Method:
5. Developed `addProduct(Product product)` method with:
   - Null validation for input parameter
   - Duplicate ID prevention using `searchProductById()`
   - ArrayList addition with boolean return for success/failure indication
   - Time complexity: O(n) due to duplicate checking

#### Remove Product Method:
6. Implemented `removeProductById(int id)` method with:
   - Stream API utilization with `removeIf()` predicate
   - ID-based matching for precise removal
   - Boolean return indicating removal success
   - Handles non-existent ID gracefully

#### Update Product Quantity Method:
7. Created `updateProductQuantity(int id, int newQuantity)` method with:
   - Input validation for negative quantity values
   - Product existence verification before update
   - Direct quantity modification using setter method
   - Success/failure boolean return with comprehensive error handling

#### Search Product by Name Method:
8. Developed `searchProductByName(String name)` method with:
   - Case-insensitive partial matching capability
   - Stream API filtering with `contains()` operation
   - Null and empty string validation
   - Returns List<Product> for multiple match support

#### Additional Utility Methods:
9. Implemented supporting methods:
   - `searchProductById(int id)` for ID-based retrieval
   - `getAllProducts()` with defensive copying to prevent external modification
   - In-memory ArrayList storage management

#### Main Class Integration:
10. Created `main` package under `src/main/java/main/`
11. Developed console-based user interface in `Main.java`:
    - Menu-driven interface with 5 core operations
    - Input validation methods with exception handling
    - Integration with ProductService for all CRUD operations
    - Sample data initialization for immediate testing

### 3. Challenges Encountered

**Stream API Complexity Challenge:** Initially struggled with implementing efficient search operations using Java Stream API, particularly for case-insensitive name searching.

**Resolution:** Researched Stream API documentation and implemented proper filtering with `toLowerCase()` and `contains()` methods:
```java
return products.stream()
    .filter(product -> product.getName().toLowerCase()
            .contains(name.toLowerCase().trim()))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

**Data Integrity Challenge:** Encountered issues with external modification of returned product lists, potentially compromising data integrity.

**Resolution:** Implemented defensive copying in `getAllProducts()` method to return new ArrayList instance while preserving original data structure.

### 4. Verification

#### Model Class Verification:
- Created test Product objects with various data combinations
- Verified all getter/setter methods return/set correct values
- Tested `getTotalValue()` calculation: price × quantity = expected result
- Confirmed `isInStock()` returns true for quantity > 0, false for quantity = 0
- Validated `toString()` method produces properly formatted output

#### CRUD Operations Verification:
- **Add Product:** Successfully added multiple products with unique IDs, confirmed duplicate prevention
- **Remove Product:** Tested removal of existing products (success) and non-existent IDs (graceful failure)
- **Update Quantity:** Updated various product quantities, verified negative value rejection
- **Search by Name:** Tested partial matching with different case combinations, confirmed accurate results

#### Integration Testing:
- Compiled entire project successfully: `javac -d target/classes src/main/java/**/*.java`
- Executed main application: `java -cp target/classes main.Main`
- Verified all menu options function correctly with sample data
- Tested complete user workflow from product addition to removal
- Confirmed data persistence within application session

#### Console Output Verification:
```
===== PRODUCT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM =====
=== MAIN MENU ===
1. Add Product
2. View All Products  
3. Search Product by ID
4. Update Product Quantity
5. Remove Product
0. Exit
```
Successfully demonstrated all operations with pre-loaded sample data and user input validation.

## Task Documentation - Day 3

**Task:** Implement Exception Handling Across the Project  
**Date Completed:** September 12, 2025

### 1. Objective
Enhance the Product Management System's reliability and user experience by implementing comprehensive exception handling mechanisms throughout all layers of the application. This includes input validation, error recovery strategies, and graceful failure handling to ensure the system remains stable and provides meaningful feedback to users even when encountering invalid inputs or unexpected conditions.

### 2. Steps Taken

#### Input Validation Framework Implementation:
1. **Replaced basic input methods with robust validation functions:**
   - `getValidInt(String prompt, int min, int max)` - Integer validation with range checking
   - `getValidDouble(String prompt, double min, double max)` - Double validation with bounds
   - `getValidString(String prompt)` - Non-empty string validation

2. **NumberFormatException Handling Implementation:**
```java
private static int getValidInt(String prompt, int min, int max) {
    while (true) {
        try {
            System.out.print(prompt);
            int value = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine().trim());
            if (value >= min && value <= max) {
                return value;
            }
            System.out.println("Please enter a number between " + min + " and " + max);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Business Logic Exception Handling:
3. **Implemented validation layers in ProductService class:**
   - **Null Parameter Validation:** Added null checks for Product objects in `addProduct()` method
   - **Duplicate ID Prevention:** Enhanced duplicate checking with proper error messaging
   - **Range Validation:** Implemented negative value checks for price and quantity
   - **Product Existence Validation:** Added existence checks before update/remove operations

4. **Enhanced Method Return Handling:**
   - Modified all service methods to return boolean success indicators
   - Implemented comprehensive error checking in Main class methods
   - Added meaningful error messages for each failure scenario

#### User Interface Exception Handling:
5. **Menu Choice Validation:**
   - Implemented try-catch blocks around menu choice processing
   - Added range validation for menu options (0-5)
   - Created infinite retry loops for invalid menu selections

6. **Operation-Specific Exception Handling:**
   - **Add Product:** Duplicate ID validation, empty name prevention, negative value checks
   - **Search Product:** ID existence validation with user-friendly "not found" messages
   - **Update Quantity:** Product existence checks, negative quantity prevention
   - **Remove Product:** Confirmation dialog with cancellation support

#### Error Recovery Strategies:
7. **Implemented graceful error recovery mechanisms:**
   - **Input Retry Loops:** Continue prompting until valid input received
   - **Operation Rollback:** Return to menu after failed operations
   - **State Preservation:** Maintain data integrity during error conditions
   - **User Notification:** Clear, non-technical error messages

8. **Exception Categorization and Handling:**
   - **Input Exceptions:** NumberFormatException, empty string validation
   - **Business Logic Exceptions:** Duplicate IDs, negative values, missing products
   - **System Exceptions:** Resource management (Scanner closure)

#### Code Quality Improvements:
9. **Simplified and optimized existing code:**
   - Reduced total lines of code from 400+ to approximately 180 lines
   - Implemented modern Java features (switch expressions, try-with-resources concepts)
   - Removed verbose comments while maintaining essential documentation
   - Enhanced code readability with consistent formatting

10. **Application Flow Enhancement:**
    - Added comprehensive main method exception handling
    - Implemented proper application lifecycle management
    - Enhanced user experience with clear prompts and error messages

### 3. Challenges Encountered

**Complex Exception Hierarchy Challenge:** Initially attempted to create custom exception classes for different error types, which overcomplicated the simple console application.

**Resolution:** Simplified approach by using built-in Java exceptions (NumberFormatException, IllegalArgumentException) with clear error messages and retry mechanisms, focusing on user experience over technical complexity.

**Input Buffer Management Challenge:** Encountered issues with Scanner buffer management when mixing different input types (integers, doubles, strings), causing input skipping problems.

**Resolution:** Standardized all input methods to use `scanner.nextLine().trim()` followed by type parsing, ensuring consistent buffer handling and preventing input skipping issues.

**Error Message Consistency Challenge:** Initial error messages were inconsistent and sometimes technical, confusing for end users.

**Resolution:** Developed standardized error message format using clear, non-technical language:
- "Invalid input! Please enter a valid number."
- "Please enter a number between X and Y"
- "Input cannot be empty!"

### 4. Verification

#### Exception Handling Verification Tests:

**Input Validation Testing:**
- **Invalid Integer Input:** Entered "abc" for product ID → Caught NumberFormatException → Displayed error → Requested retry
- **Out of Range Values:** Entered negative product ID → Range validation triggered → Clear error message → Retry successful
- **Empty String Input:** Pressed Enter for product name → Empty validation triggered → Error message → Retry successful
- **Invalid Double Input:** Entered "price" for product price → NumberFormatException caught → User-friendly message → Retry successful

**Business Logic Exception Testing:**
- **Duplicate Product ID:** Attempted to add product with existing ID → Duplicate check triggered → Clear error message → Operation cancelled
- **Non-existent Product Operations:** Tried to update product with ID 999 → Product not found validation → Informative message → Return to menu
- **Negative Value Prevention:** Attempted to set negative quantity → Validation triggered → Error message → Value rejected

**System Stability Testing:**
- **Continuous Invalid Input:** Entered invalid data repeatedly → System remained stable → No crashes → Consistent error handling
- **Menu Navigation:** Invalid menu choices → Range validation → Clear options display → Successful retry
- **Resource Management:** Application exit → Scanner properly closed → Clean termination

#### Comprehensive Application Testing:
```bash
# Compilation Test
javac -d target/classes src/main/java/**/*.java
# Result: No compilation errors

# Execution Test  
java -cp target/classes main.Main
# Result: Application launches successfully with exception handling active
```

**Real-Time Exception Handling Verification:**
1. **Product Addition with Invalid Data:**
   ```
   Enter Product ID: abc
   Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.
   Enter Product ID: -5
   Please enter a number between 1 and 2147483647
   Enter Product ID: 10
   # Successful validation and continuation
   ```

2. **Update Operation with Non-existent Product:**
   ```
   Enter Product ID: 999
   No product found with ID: 999
   # Graceful return to main menu
   ```

3. **Menu Choice Validation:**
   ```
   Enter your choice: 10
   Please enter a number between 0 and 5
   Enter your choice: abc
   Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.
   Enter your choice: 2
   # Successful menu navigation
   ```
